# Standard Operating Environment 
#### About
This is a repo that tries to standardise my setup across home/work with Arch Linux on bare metal and VirtualBox.

+ So far: Packer building Arch-latest, with VirtualBox guest additions and Chef from AUR.
+ Eventually: Chef cookbooks for general setup and cloning/application of my dotfiles repo.
